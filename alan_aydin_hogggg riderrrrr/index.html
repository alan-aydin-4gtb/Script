            <h3>Observer investigation reveals how the ex-kickboxer and Big Brother contestant from Luton has gone from obscurity to global internet fame in months</h2>
            <p>Andrew Tate says women belong in the home, can’t drive, and are a man’s property.

                He also thinks rape victims must “bear responsibility” for their attacks and dates women aged 18–19 because he can “make an imprint” on them, according to videos posted online.
